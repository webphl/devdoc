## Package Reducer


Reducer file must be marked as `@type: reducer`, see [annotation](/frontend/concepts#annotation)

```tsx
/**
 * @type: reducer
 * name: blog
*/

import {
    combineReducers,
    createEntityReducer
} from '@metafox/framework';
import { APP_NAME } from '../constants';

export default combineReducers({
    entities: createEntityReducer(APP_NAME),
});
```

metafox bundle service combine all reducers file to `./app/src/bundle/produce.tsx`.

when you add/remove a new reducer file, you must run `yarn metafox reload` to update bundle file.
