# Concepts

## Privacy

When users post items ... on their profile pages, they can set who can see their posts with their memberships

For example: A user can post a blog and set the privacy with their **memberships**:

- friends
- Specific friend lists

In order to keep design cleaned, **privacy** should be centralized to a place, so it's have a global unique ID.
Then we can map **membership** to **privacy** concept as simple as possible.

## Action Entity

**ActionEntity** is Models which defines who did the action on a Content (can be Content or User - since User was a child of Content).

For example: when users do something, for example: like, share, friend request v.v..., Those Models are called **ActionEntity**.

## Role & Permissions

Think **role** as **user_group** in phpFox V4

Think **permissions** as **user_group_params** in phpFox V4. Has two type:

- Permission with boolean value
- Permission with actual value

## Policy

When user posts a comment, writes a blogs, shares a content ... platform has to verify **role** & **permission** to see if the user is allowed to perform such actions

When a user posts on others profile pages, platform also have to check **membership** and **privacy** of the profile owner.

To reduce duplicated and keep code cleaned, in platform we will centralize all checking of **permission** and **privacy** to **Policy**.

In Policy, every action we have 5 privacy layers:

- Role/Permission

```php
$user->hasPermissionTo('resource.view'); // return bool.
```

- Privacy Owner

```php
use MetaFox\Platform\Support\Facades\PrivacyPolicy;

PrivacyPolicy::checkPermissionOwner($user, $owner); // return bool.
```

- User Privacy Setting of Owner

```php
use MetaFox\User\Support\Facades\UserPrivacy;

UserPrivacy::hasAccess($user->entityId(), $owner->entityId(), 'blog.view_browse_blogs'); // return bool.
```

- Resource Setting: consider to use it on which level depends on context.

```php
use MetaFox\Platform\Facades\Settings;

Settings::get('blog.privacy_enabled'); // return mixed (your module is free to define var type).

```

- Privacy Resource

```php
use MetaFox\Platform\Support\Facades\PrivacyPolicy;

PrivacyPolicy::checkPermission($user, $resource); // return bool.
```

## Event

Laravel's **Event** is a implementation of [Observer Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)

**Event** is simple way to decouple package dependencies and extends platform features. It can be thought as a replacement of MetaFox plugins.

### Using Event to notify an action

When a new user is registered, we can notify an action `user_created` with `$user` data.

```php
<?php
events()->dispatch('user_created', $user);
```

All listeners registered to the action `user_registered` will handle the action as below

```php
class UserCreatedListener
{
  public function handle($user){
      // put your code here
  }
}
```

### Using Event to interact

```php
$response = event()->dispatch('get_package_settings');
```

```php
class PackageSettingListener
{
  function handle()
  {
    return ['add_new_setting'=>['database_down']];
  }
}
```

### Using Event to call APIs of other Apps

```php
event()->dispatch('create_new_feed', $action);
```

```php
class CreateFeedActionHandler
{
  public function handle($action)
  {
      $feedService->createAction($action);
  }
}
```

## Model Observer

**Model Observer** is the integration of `Eloquent` Model and **Event** system with events of `creating`, `created`, `updating`, `updated`, `deleting`, `deleted`.

```php
class PostObserver
{

  public function creating($post)
  {
    // this method is invoked automatically when Blog is created
  }


  public function created($post)
  {
    // this method is invoked automatically when Blog is created
  }

  // others
}
```

## Feed & Stream

When a user post blogs, video, photo, ... platform will centralize these actions into feed, and other users can see and interact with.

To keep feed in as simple as possible, the platform will organize feed item as below:

Each `feed` contains info of `item_type`, `item_id`, `user_id`, `user_type`, `owner_id`, `owner_type`, `type_id`
Note:
`item_type`, `item_id`: specify the item mentioned about
`user_type`, `user_id`: specific **User** who is created item
`owner_type`, `owner_id`: specific **User** where item is posted to (other users, on a page, on a group v.v...)
`type_id`: to categorize feed, feed abilities: **can_comment**, **can_like**, **can_share**, **can_edit**, **can_create_feed**, **can_put_stream**.

### When a feed is created, how to deliver it ?

The trouble comes when feed owner set privacy to many friend lists. We can not keep many **Privacy** in single feed record, So we put **Feed** + **Privacy** to other `feed_stream` tables. It has info of `feed_id`, `privacy_id`, `owner_id` so we can deliver feed in flexible way.
Note:
`privacy_id`: specify who can see
`owner_id`: specify profile page

## Storage & Disk

We have `core_storage_services` : currently we support **AWS S3** and **Local**. For each storage service, we can have multiple **Config** instances (`core_storage`).

- Config in config/filesystems.php

## Scope

When you want to add custom query to Query Builder, use **Scope**. MetaFox supports:

- [Global scopes](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent#global-scopes): this way is not recommended because it will add to Model static and apply for the whole request process.
- [Local scopes](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent#local-scopes): written inside Model, but it isn't recommended to write too much in Model, should only create **Scope** that will always be used.

### How to apply Scope:

When we build query, we can create a **Scope** and apply it into current Query.

Example:

```php

$exampleScope = new ExampleScope();
$exampleScope->setSomeAttribute('123');

$model = new Model();
$query = $model->newQuery()->applyScope($exampleScope);
$data = $query->get();

```
