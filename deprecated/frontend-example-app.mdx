# Introduction

In this article, we will guide you to develop a new _Notes_ app that allows users to share notes. End users can post new notes, edit their notes, share their notes to Activity Feed, etc.

**Table Of Contents**

- Create a landing page of _Notes_ app
- Add an existing page to the Main Menu
- Add a new portable block
- Work with `apiClient`
- Display listing of items.

## Skeleton

Firstly, we are going to create a app skeleton. Let's open Terminal and move to the root of your workbox where the _Frontend_ source code is located, then execute the following command

```shell script
yarn create-app --package=@example/module-note --item=note
```

After running the above command, the skeleton of your _Notes_ app will be created under `packages/example-notes` folder

## Directory Structure

```text
module-note/
  package.json
    src/
      components/
      containers/
      reducers/
      sagas/
      pages/
```

## Landing Page

In this section, we will guide you step-by-step to add the Landing page at route `/note`.

**Step 1**: Create page components

```tsx
/**
 * @type: route
 * path: /note
 * pageName: note.langing
 */

#file pages/HomePage/HomePage.tsx

import * as React from 'react';
import { Page } from '@metafox/framework';

const HomePage = props => {
  return (
    <Page pageName="note.home"  pageLayout={{}} />
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

**Step 02**: Declare layouts

Add new JSON file `src/pages/HomePage/package.json` as below content

```json
{ "main": "HomePage.tsx" }
```

**Step 03**: Verify

Reload browser and go to `/note` to verify result.

## Configure Layout

Add new file `pages/HomePage/layout.json` with the below content

```tsx
{
  blocks: [
  ],
}
```

## Block

Create custom block, to view simple featured notes.

**Step 01**: Create a Block

Add new file `components/BlockFeatureNotes.tsx` with the below content

```tsx
/**
 * @type: block
 * name: note.block.featuredNotes
 */

import * as React from "react";

import { createBlock } from "@metafox/framework";

// Implement base component
const BlockFeatureNotes = ({ title = "Featured Notes" }: Props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>{title}</h4>
      <div>Display Featured Notes</div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default createBlock({
  extendBlock: BlockFeatureNotes,
});
```

**Step 02**: Verify

Open live edit mode, click on `Add new block`, you will see the `Featured Notes` block here.

You can choose the block to add and then export layout to other pages.
