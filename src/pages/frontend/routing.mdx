# Router

## Table of Contents
In this document, we will go through the following topics:
- Dynamic/Async Routing
- Router and Code Splitting
- Router and Transition
- Router and Loading progress
- Router and Modal

Firstly, let's take a look at MetaFox's URL structure

- `/`: Display `home` page or `user.home` page based on the user authentication state.
- `/blog`: Display `user.browse` page.
- `/blog/my`: Display `user.browse.my` page.
- `/user`: Display `user.browse` page.
- `/user/profile/1`: Display profile of user
- `/pages/profile/14`: Display profile of pages
- `/groups/profile/12`: Display profile of groups
- `/jack`: Display `user.profile` page, alias of `/user/profile/1`
- `/jack/photo`: Display `user.profile.photo` page, alias of `/user/profile/1/photo`
- `/barca`: Display `pages.profile` as alias of `/pages/profile/14`
- `/barca/groups`: Display `pages.profile.groups` as alias of `/pages/profile/14/photo`
- `/nancy-club`: Display private `groups.profile` as alias of `/group/profile/12`

By using `react-router-dom` and `React.lazy`, we can structure React components:

```javascript
<Router>
  <Switch>
    <Route path="/" component={HomePage} />
    <Route path="/blog" component={BlogPage} />
    <Route path="/blog/my" component={MyBlogPage} />
    <Route path="/user/profile/:userId" component={UserProfilePage} />
    <Route
      path="/user/profile/:userId/photo"
      component={UserProfilePhotoPage}
    />
    <Route path="/pages/profile/:pageId" component={PageProfilePage} />
    <Route
      path="/pages/profile/:pageId/photo"
      component={PageProfilePhotoPage}
    />
    <Route path="/groups/profile/:groupId" component={GroupProfilePage} />
    ... Others Routes
    <NoMatchRoute />
  </Switch>
</Router>
```

As you see `/`, `blog`,`blog/my` are static regex URLs, they can be solved easily by using regex or literal strings.

While `/jack`, `jack/photo`, `/barca`, `/barca/groups` is more difficult, we have to query database to check if terms of `jack`, `barca` are for  usernames or page slugs.


1. Router gets a request with the pathname `/jack/photo`
2. Check router path but no matched
3. Keep previous matched Route, showing loading progress bar.
4. Send async request to get canonical pathname of url `/jack/photo` 
5. If getting the canonical pathname `/user/profile/1/photo`, replace current location state, keep location pathname.
6. Router tries to re-run with `/user/profile/1/photo` pathname.


### Best Practices:

- Application can be configured to use either Loading progress bar or Empty waiting screen
- Should use nested route in user/pages/event profile page. TBD.
- Do not base on the browser location. Instead, when developing UI, use `$PageContext` to ask the context to query content instead of browser location.

## Code Splitting

Because of app sizing, we have to split code of every Page components. [read more](/technical/code-splitting)

At the first time visiting `/user` page, the associated chunk file is not ready. Thus, if the network speed is around 1 second, end users may see a flash animation.

## Modal Route

Here is the sample code for a Modal

```text
{
  sampleModalDialog: {
    modal: true,
    path: '/m/example/simple-modal',
    component: loadable(() => import('./pages/ExampleModal')),
  },
  sampleModalPage: {
    path: '/m/example/simple-modal',
    component: loadable(() => import('./pages/ExampleModalPage')),
  },
}
```

You have to create two routes, the first route is for Modal Route, and the seconds is Page Route. You can declare them in `routes.ts` file, with the same path but add property `modal`.

#### How to disable modal dialog on mobile device?
