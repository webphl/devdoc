## Structure

The MetaFox directory structure extends the Laravel framework directory structure. Please read [laravel directory structure](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/structure) for more details.

```text
app/            : Contains the core code of laravel framework
bootstrap/      : Laravel default, don't change
  app.php       :
  cache/        : Contains framework generated files for performance optimization such as the route and services cache files.
config/         : Contains root of your application's configuration files.
database/       : Contains root database migrations, model factories, and seeds.
packages/       : All MetaFox packages
  metafox/      : Contains MetaFox core packages
  platform/     : Contains MetaFox framework code.
public/         : Laravel defaults
  .htaccess
  robot.txt
  index.php     : Entry point for all requests
resources/      : Laravel default
routes/         : Laravel default
storage/        : Laravel default
  logs/         : Contains your file based logs files
  app/
    public/     : Contains users uploaded files
tests/          : Contains root automated tests
vendor/         : Contains your Composer dependencies.
```

Now, we'll look into directories deeper

#### app Directory

The `app` directory contains the core code of Laravel framework. You should not change this source code to keep your application is upgradable.

#### bootstrap Directory

The `bootstrap` directory contains the `app.php` file which bootstraps the framework. This directory also has a `cache` directory which contains  generated files for performance optimization such as the route and services cache files. You don't need to modify any files within this directory.

#### config Directory

The `config` directory contains root of your application's configuration files. It's a great idea to read through all of configuration files and familiarize yourself with all of the available options.

#### database Directory

The `database` directory contains root database migrations, model factories, and seeds. Also, you can use this directory to hold an SQLite database.

#### public Directory

The `public` directory contains the `index.php` file, which is the entrypoint for all requests entering your application and configures autoloading. This directory also contains your assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS.

#### resources Directory

The `resources` directory contains your views as well as your raw, un-compiled assets such as CSS or JavaScript.

#### routes Directory

The `routes` directory contains root of the route definitions for your application. By default, several route files are included with Laravel, such as: `web.php`, `api.php`, `console.php`, and `channels.php`.

The `web.php` file contains routes that the `RouteServiceProvider` places in the web middleware group, which provides session state, CSRF protection, and cookie encryption. If your application does not support stateless RESTful API then it is likely that all of your routes will most likely be defined in the `web.php` file.

The `api.php` file contains routes that the `RouteServiceProvider` places in the API middleware group. These routes are intended to be stateless, so requests entering the application through these routes need to be authenticated via tokens and will not have access to session state.

The `console.php` file is where you may define all of your closure based console commands. Each closure is bounded to a `command` instance allowing a simple approach to interact with each command's IO methods. Even though this file does not define HTTP routes, it defines console based entrypoints (routes) into your application.

The `channels.php` file is where you may register all of the event broadcasting channels that your application supports.

### storage Directory

The `/storage` directory contains your logs, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. This directory is segregated into `app`, `framework`, and `logs` directories. The `app` directory may be used to store any files generated by your application. The `framework` directory is used to store framework generated files and caches. Finally, the `logs` directory contains your application's log files.

The `storage/app/public` directory may be used to store user-generated files, such as profile avatars, that should be publicly accessible. You should create a symbolic link at `public/storage` which points to this directory. You may create the link using the `php artisan storage:link` Artisan command.

#### tests Directory

The `/tests` directory contains root automated tests. Example PHPUnit unit tests and feature tests are provided out of the box. Each test class should be suffixed with `Test`. You may run your tests using the `phpunit` or `php vendor/bin/phpunit` commands. Or, if you would like a more detailed and beautiful representation of your test results, you may run your tests using the `php artisan test` Artisan command.

#### vendor Directory

The `vendor` directory contains your Composer dependencies.
