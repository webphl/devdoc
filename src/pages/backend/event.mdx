# Event

> Laravel's *Events* provides a simple Observer pattern implementation, allowing you to subscribe and listen to various events that occur within your application. *Event* classes are typically stored in the `app/Events` directory, while their *Listeners* are stored in `app/Listeners` directory. Don't worry if you don't see these directories in your application as they will be created automatically as you generate events and listeners using *Artisan console* commands.

> Events serve as a great way to decouple various aspects of your application, since a single event can have multiple listeners that do not depend on each other. For example, you may wish to send a Slack notification to your user each time an order has shipped. Instead of coupling your order processing code to your Slack notification code, you can raise an `App\Events\OrderShipped` event which a listener can receive and use to dispatch a Slack notification.

## Dispatch Event

For example, dispatch an event named `search.updated` and pass `$model` argurment. All *Listener* classes registered with the `search.updated` event will be processed.

```php
<?php

app('events')->dispatch('search.updated', [$model]);

```

## Listeners

Define *Event Listener*

```php
<?php
// file packages/metafox/blog/src/Listeners/SearchUpdatedListener.php

namespace  MetaFox\Blog\Listeners;

class SearchUpdatedListener
{
   /**
    * Handle event
    */
   public function handle($model)
   {
      return 1;
   }
}

```

To improve performance, **MetaFox** requires manual event listener registration via `PackageSettingListener` class.

```php
<?php
namespace MetaFox\ToDo\Listeners;

class PackageSettingListener extends BasePackageSettingListener {

    /**
     * Get array of events
     */
    public function getEvents()
    {
        return [
            'search.updated'          => [
                SearchUpdatedListener::class,
            ],
        ];
    }
}
```

## Response

**TBD**

For futher info, please read [Laravel Event](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/events#main-content)

## Bail

Sometimes, you may need dispatcher to stop running other listeners whenever a listener returns a not-null value.

```php
<?php

$response = app('events')->dispatch('search.updated', [$model], $bail=true);

```

In the above sample code, with `$bail=true` parameter, at the first time a listener returns not-null value, the dispatcher will stop running remaining registered *Listener* and returns to `$response` value.
