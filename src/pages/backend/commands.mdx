# Commands

In this topic, we are going to discuss about most frequently commands which can be executed on Linux terminal.

We'll assume that you are familiar with Linux terminal. Firstly, please open the terminal, log in SSH to the `Backend` server, and go to the source folder of MetaFox Backend. If the MetaFox Backend is set up  with a Docker container, you can run the ```docker exec``` command to log in to the running container.

Here is a list of Linux commands:

```bash

# List all supported commands
php artisan list

# Install fresh MetaFox site
bash ./scripts/install.sh

# Update MetaFox site
php artisan metafox:update
```
