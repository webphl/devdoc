# MetaFox Developer Installation

This _MetaFox Developer_ package includes the MetaFox Core and some basic apps such as `Feed`, `Photos`, `Members`, `Blogs`, `Polls`.

## System Requirements

On the Development environment: since we have to build MetaFox Frontend, your server will need to have at least **4G RAM** as the [Recommendation for React](https://reacts.com/system-requirements/)

This article will guide you how to set up Local Development with `docker`. Thus, the server will need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed first.

## Download Source

You can download Developer source from Client Area, under `MetaFox Dev license`. Then, extract the package on your server.

For example, all source files will be uploaded to your server under `home/metafox` folder

## Local Installation Steps

Open Terminal and log in SSH to your server. It is necessary to note that you will need to log in with SSH user having permissions to run `docker`

Then, run the following command

```
cd /home/metafox
bash install.sh
```

After starting successfully, you can check the MetaFox site at `http://your_server_IP:8081` or `http://your_domain:8081`
